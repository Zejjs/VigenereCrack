# VignereCrack

A console based program used for deciphering Vigenere-cipher encoded messages.


The cipher text is loaded from the "ciphertext.txt" file, and the program outputs plain text into "plaintext.txt"


The program offers three ways of cracking the code:
1. user provides the key (trivial case)
2. dictionary attack
3. Kasinski-Babbage examination


Written as my final project for the Harvard CS50 course in 2018, this is a public reupload thereof.
